            <p class="card-text">
                <b>Local Storage :</b> This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage
                object,
                the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage
                data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the
                last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing
                or incognito session).

                DOMStrings are storage formats that use UTF-16 to encode data, which uses two bytes per character.
                Strings are automatically generated from integer keys just as they are for objects. The data stored in
                LocalStorage is specific to a protocol in the document. If the site is loaded over HTTP (e.g.,
                http://example.com), localStorage returns a different object than if it is loaded over HTTPS (e.g.,
                https://abc.com).

                If a document is loaded from a file: URL (that is, directly from the user’s local file system instead of
                being loaded from the server) the requirements for behavior are undefined and may vary among different
                browsers. Each file appears to be returned a different object by localStorage in all current browsers:
                URL. Essentially, it seems to be a case of each URL: file having its own unique local storage area.

                This behavior cannot be guaranteed because as mentioned above, the file: URL requirements remain
                unclear. As such, there’s a possibility that browsers may change how they handle files at any time. The
                way some browsers handle it has evolved. <br>

                <b>Session Storage :</b>Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only
                property. The difference
                between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas
                sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

                A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid
                for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the browser is
                open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is created each time a tab
                or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with the
                same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage from the original
                tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and clears sessionStorage
                objects.

                A page’s protocol determines what data is stored in sessionStorage. Particularly, data stored by scripts
                accessed through HTTP (for example, http://abc.com) is stored in a separate object from the same site
                accessed through HTTPS (for instance, https://abc.com). A DOMString number is two bytes per character in
                UTF-16 DOMString format. Strings are automatically generated from integer keys just as they are for
                objects.

            <h2 class="card-title fw-bold py-3">Difference Between Global Scope & Block Scope in JS</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
                JavaScript ES6 has different ways to declare and use variables. This often leds to confusion about when
                to use which keyword, in this article I have made this easy to figure out when to use which keyword.

                In order to know which keyword to use we must first know about the scope in javascript. As the name says
                it 'scope' means which variable is accessible and upto which point it is accessible.
                So, in javascript the whole document is global scope and all the other functions and variables are
                contained in this global scope.

                Another is the Local Scope, variables declared inside the functions are considered to be of the local
                scope and it is futher divided into function scoped and block scoped.

                Function Scope: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that
                function and cannot be used outside that function.

                Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops,
                are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the
                curly braces are called as within block scope.

                Coming back to the use of keywords,
                var is called as function scope that is if a variable is declared using var keyword it will be
                accessible throughout the function.

                let & const are also called as block scope that is they are accessible within that particular block.
                Here let is used for variable which can be changed as we proceed through the program whereas const is
                used for a variable which doesn’t change till the program ends, that is it remains constant throughout
                the program.

            <h2 class="card-title fw-bold py-3">How js event loop works</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
                The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on
                a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
                Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end.



                The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a
                function is finished, it is popped from the stack.

                The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the
                queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for
                execution.

                Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the
                browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded
                operation.

                An example of this is the setTimeout method. When a setTimeout operation is processed in the stack, it
                is sent to the corresponding API which waits till the specified time to send this operation back in for
                processing.

                Where does it send the operation? The event queue. Hence, we have a cyclic system for running async
                operations in JavaScript. The language itself is single-threaded, but the browser APIs act as separate
                threads.

                The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If
                it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current function call
                is processed.

            <h2 class="card-title  fw-bold py-3">How many ways we get undefined in javascript?</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
                JavaScript provides some primitive as well as non-primitive data types. For example “null”, “boolean”,
                “undefined”, etc. belong to the primitive data type while “arrays”, and “objects” are non-primitive or
                complex data types. In JavaScript, any variable that is not assigned with any value has a default value
                of “undefined”.<br><br>
                In JavaScript, the undefined is a primitive type and has only one value “undefined”. A variable that is
                declared/created but not assigned with a value anywhere in the program has a default value of
                “undefined”. This write-up explained what exactly an undefined type is? It’s syntax and use-cases with
                the help of examples. <br> <br>The typeof operator returned undefined which verified that an unassigned
                variable has a default value of “undefined”.The undefined type belongs to the primitive data types that
                can have only one value i.e. undefined. A variable that is declared/created but not assigned with a
                value anywhere in the program has a default value of “undefined”.
